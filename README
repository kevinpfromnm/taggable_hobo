Requires acts_as_taggable_on_steroids and hobo to load before this plugin.

  Added these primarily to be able to use hobo model controller easily.  Also, these define standard hobo permissions, current view is all and edit is admin only.

Controllers:
  tags
    Provides a show and index view.  Show lists and links all items tagged with the tag.
  tagging
    Provides a name-one completer and delete,create ajax functionality.

Views:
  tags:
    show - shows links to tagged content as well
    index - tag cloud like view

Tags:
  tag-list
    Parameters:
      tag-heading:
      collection-wrap: Note: if you replace this, you'll need to redo the tags 'part' entirely.  Limitation of not being able to use param under a part.
      form:
        label:
    Lists tags as a collection and form if user has rights to add tags (see model permissions).
  
  show-page for="Tag"
    Uses taggings as the collection and then shows a list of each taggable, it's class and a link to the object

  index-page for="Tag"
    Uses the tag_cloud helper from acts_as_taggable_on_steroids to generate a list of all tags and links to each tags show page.

Stylesheet:
  taggable_hobo.css
    This is NOT being moved in on install.  They are suggested styles for formatting the tag cloud and delete button on tag-list.

Example
=======

Include this line after your rapid and auto taglib includes but before any tag related overrides.
<include src="taglist" plugin="taggable_hobo" />

Add <tag-list /> somewhere on your show page for a model that has tags.

Copy the styles from public/stylesheets/taggable_hobo.css to your public/stylesheets/application.css if desired.  Otherwise, define styles for cloud1-cloud5 styles for your tag cloud display.  1 is fewest tags and 5 is most.
